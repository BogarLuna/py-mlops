Basic Docker CLI Commands:

    docker run: Use this command to create and start a new container based on an image. You can specify options such as port mapping, volume mounting, and environment variables.

    docker ps: This command lists the running containers on your system, providing information about their status, names, and IDs.

    docker images: Use this command to view a list of available Docker images on your system. These images serve as the blueprints for creating containers.

    docker build: This command is used for building a Docker image from a Dockerfile, which is a script that specifies how to create the image.

    docker pull: Use this command to download Docker images from a container registry, such as Docker Hub.

    docker stop and docker start: These commands allow you to stop and start containers, respectively.

    docker rm: This command removes one or more containers. Be cautious with this command, as it permanently deletes containers.

    docker rmi: Use this command to remove one or more images. Make sure you don't need the image anymore before deleting it.

Advanced Docker CLI Usage:

    docker exec: You can execute commands inside a running container using this command. It's useful for troubleshooting or interacting with a container's shell.

    docker logs: This command provides access to the logs generated by a running container, which is helpful for debugging and monitoring.

    docker-compose: Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container applications in a single file. You can use the docker-compose command to start, stop, and manage these multi-container setups.

    docker network: Docker allows you to create custom networks to connect containers. This command helps you manage network configurations for your containers.
